# KiwiElGato-Website-1.0-2022
 
 The most meaningful commitment I had outside the classroom during High School was the online educational resource I created, Kiwi-El-Gato; fondly named after my pet cat, Kiwi, who died October 2020. What began as a few fun YouTube videos, has evolved into an educational resource that has helped many of my fellow students.

 Kiwi-El-Gato encompasses instructional videos, educational resources, and tutorials for high school students, all created from a studentâ€™s perspective. This website orginially created in the summer of 2021 has been improved and worked on over the past year to make it more user friendly and have a more fun and dynamic feel. This is the first coding project I've ever undergone and I am always looking to improve it.

 All of my HTML/CSS files are organized by page of the website (e.g. index.html is the main page for the website) and my scripts are named after the specific function I used it for in my page (e.g. loadWheel.js is for the loadwheel animation).
